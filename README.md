3. Look at EXAMPLE_PROFILES.md for inspiration from other developers

## Quick Tips
- Keep it concise - visitors should get key information quickly
- Update regularly - stale information looks unprofessional
- Show personality - let your unique qualities shine through
- Include a profile photo - adds a personal touch
- Use emojis sparingly - they add visual interest but don't overdo it

## Common Issues
- If your stats aren't showing up, double-check your username in the URLs
- If images aren't displaying, verify the image URLs are correct
- Remember that GitHub has some HTML limitations for security reasons
